The "Mind-Mend" website project aims to make mental health resources easily accessible in today's technology-driven world. It serves as a supportive platform for individuals seeking help, information, and community related to various mental health issues. The main goal is to enhance awareness of mental illnesses and support services by providing articles, self-help books, and contact information for mental health professionals.

 The project team engaged experts, users, and college students through interviews, surveys, and focus groups to identify user needs before the launch. Key focuses included increasing user participation and delivering science-based mental health practices. Research revealed a strong demand for resources addressing anxiety, depression, stress, and emotional health. Many individuals desire mental health support but face barriers such as stigma, lack of affordable care, and poor mental health literacy. "Mind-Mend" addresses these issues by offering free resources and affordable professional contacts, along with discussion boards and support groups to foster community and connection. Online therapeutic services are also available through the platform
